WHAT IS FLEXLINK?
FlexLink provides users with information about different movies, directors, and genres. The server-side of the FlixLink application will ensure they have access to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be stored.

Users will be able to create an account with which to enter, maintain, and update their personal information, as well as create a customized list of their favorite movies.

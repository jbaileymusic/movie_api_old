        <h1>FLIXLINK Documentation</h1>
        <p>GOAL: To build the server-side component of a web application called FlixLink.<br>
            The app is designed to provide users with information about different movies,
            directors, and genres. The server-side of the FlixLink application will ensure they have access
            to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
            stored.
            Users will be able to create an account with which to enter, maintain, and update their personal information, as well as create a customized list of their favorite movies.</p>
